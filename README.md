## WHAT I LEARNED (REACT ROUTER)

- React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application.
- You can install it using `npm install react-router-dom`.

### use `<NavLink>` instead of `<Link>`

- `<NavLink>` is a special version of the `<Link>` that will add styling attributes to the rendered element when it matches the current URL.
- For example, if current URL is `/about`, then the element will receive the `active` class name.
- We can select that using CSS (pseudo class) and style it however we want.
